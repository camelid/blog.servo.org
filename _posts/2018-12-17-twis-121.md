In the [past two weeks](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2018-12-03..2018-12-17+user%3Aservo+),
we merged 113 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

There are some interesting ideas [being considered](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/a69zh3/usefulness_of_asyncawait_for_gc_in_rust/) about how to improve GC safety in Servo.

### Planning and Status

Our [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online, including the overall plans for 2018.

This week's status updates are [here](https://build.servo.org/standups/).
