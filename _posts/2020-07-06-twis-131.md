Welcome back everyone - it's been a year without written updates, but we're getting this train back on track! Servo hasn't been
dormant in that time; the biggest news was the public release of [Firefox Reality](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/p/firefox-reality/9npq78m7nb0r?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
(built on Servo technology) in the Microsoft store.

In the [past week](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2020-06-30..2020-07-06+user%3Aservo+),
we merged 44 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

The latest nightly builds for common platforms are available at [download.servo.org](https://download.servo.org/).
