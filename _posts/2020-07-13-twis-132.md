In the [past week](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2020-07-06..2020-07-13+user%3Aservo+),
we merged 64 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

The latest nightly builds for common platforms are available at [download.servo.org](https://download.servo.org/).

Servo now has the ability to record 360 degree videos of immersive web content like [this three.js rollercoaster](http://rawcdn.githack.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/examples/webxr_vr_rollercoaster.html):
