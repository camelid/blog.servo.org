In the [past week](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2020-07-20..2020-07-27+user%3Aservo+),
we merged 69 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

The latest nightly builds for common platforms are available at [download.servo.org](https://download.servo.org/).

Servo has been successfully [integrated](https://blog.mozvr.com/a-browser-plugin-for-unity/) into 3d Unity scenes as a 2d browser plugin.

Our macOS nightly builds last week panicked on launch due to missing shared libraries. That issue has been fixed.
