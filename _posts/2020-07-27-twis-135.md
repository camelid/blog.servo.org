In the [past two weeks](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2020-07-27..2020-08-10+user%3Aservo+),
we merged 108 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

The latest nightly builds for common platforms are available at [download.servo.org](https://download.servo.org/).

Last week we released [Firefox Reality v1.2](https://www.microsoft.com/p/firefox-reality/9npq78m7nb0r), which includes a smoother
developer tools experience, along with support for Unity WebXR content and self-signed SSL certificates. See the
[full release notes](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Firefox-Reality-release-notes) for more information about the new release.
